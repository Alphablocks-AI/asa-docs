Follow these steps to connect Asa to your Shopify account using a **custom app with Admin API access**. This setup lets Asa learn from your product listings, metafields, blogs, pages, and store policies.

### **Step 1: Create a Custom App in Shopify**

- In your Shopify dashboard, go to **Settings** \> **Apps and Sales Channels** \> **Develop Apps**
- Click **Create App**

_If you can’t access the _**_Develop Apps_**_ section, you may not have the required permissions. Check _[_<u>Shopify’s guide</u>_](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types/custom-apps)_ or contact your store admin. If you’re still having trouble, feel free to reach out to us at _[**_<u>help@alphablocks.ai</u>_**](mailto:help@alphablocks.ai)**_._**

### **Step 3: Configure Admin API Access**

- Go to the **Configuration** tab
- Click **Configure** next to **Admin API Integration**
- Select the following scopes:
  - read_metaobjects, 
  - read_legal_policies, 
  - read_customers, 
  - read_draft_orders, 
  - read_order_edits, 
  - read_orders, 
  - read_third_party_fulfillment_orders, 
  - read_assigned_fulfillment_orders, 
  - read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders, 
  - read_products, 
  - read_content,
  - read_fulfillments, 
  - read_custom_fulfillment_services, 
  - read_inventory, 
  - read_locations, 
  - read_markets_home, 
  - read_product_listings, 
  - read_publications, 
  - read_metaobject_definitions
- Click **Save**, then **Install App**

### **Step 4: Get Your Admin API Token**

- In your Shopify dashboard, go to the **API Credentials** tab.
- Under **Admin API Access Token**, click **Reveal token once**.
- Copy the token and save it somewhere secure — you won’t be able to view it again after this step.

_This token gives Asa access only to the specific data types you allowed in Step 3. Please store it securely — you’ll need it in the next step._

### **Step 5: Connect Shopify in Asa**

- In your **Asa dashboard**, go to **Add Content**, open the **Integrations** tab, and click **Connect** under **Shopify**.
- You’ll be asked to enter the following details:
  - **Admin API Access Token**:
  - Paste the token you saved from Step 4.
  - **Storefront Public URL**:
  - This is your live store URL — for example:

    `https://example.com` or `https://acme.com`.
  - **Shopify Subdomain**:
  - In Shopify, go to **Settings \> Domains** and find the domain that ends in `.myshopify.com`.

    If your admin URL is:

    `https://admin.shopify.com/store/acme/settings/domains`

    Then your subdomain is: `acme`.

_Make sure all fields are filled in accurately before clicking _**_Connect_**_ to complete the setup._

### **Step 6: Select Content and Train**

- After connecting, a dialog will open to select products, blogs, pages, or policies
- If it doesn’t appear, click the **(:list-plus:)** icon next to **Connected** under Shopify
- Choose the content you want Asa to learn from and click **Add Content**

Training usually takes a couple of minutes.

To verify everything is working, go to **Manage Content** \> **Integrations** and check the training status of the selected items.

### **Notes**

- Use the <Icon icon="list-ul" /> icon next to Shopify to add more content or retrain updated items anytime
- You must have the right permissions to create custom apps in Shopify
- For secure setup, only the scopes you selected are accessed by Asa — nothing more
