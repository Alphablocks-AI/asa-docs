## **How are Assists counted**

**Asa pricing is based on Assists — only when we meaningfully help.**

You’re billed when Asa resolves a shopper’s buying-related need without a human handoff. No greetings, no filler — just real value, clearly counted.

### **What is an assist?**

An **Assist** is a resolved, buying-related conversation completed fully by Asa.

It counts whether the shopper is purchasing now or simply getting information to move closer to purchase — just like a store associate on the shop floor.

**Examples of Assists:**

- Product recommendations
- Buying guidance (e.g., “Which moisturizer is best for sensitive skin?”)
- Pre-purchase questions (shipping, returns, ingredients, sizing)
- Objection handling (e.g., “Is this safe for pregnancy?”)
- Cross-sell or upsell suggestions

### **❌ What does not count as an Assist?**

- Greetings or small talk with no commercial intent
- Off-topic conversations unrelated to purchase
- Pure post-purchase support (e.g., order tracking) with no upsell
- Any conversation escalated to a human agent

### **How an Assist is Counted**

A conversation counts as an **Assist** if:

1. The shopper’s need is resolved by Asa within a session (30-minute inactivity window).
2. The shopper either:
   - Confirms Asa was helpful (e.g., clicks **That helped 👍** or types clear affirmation).
   - Takes a buying action (**Add to Cart**, **Buy Now**, **Visit Product Page**).
   - Leaves without asking for further help.

If unresolved, the conversation moves into **Closed** state for a 12-hour grace period:

- If the shopper comes back and requests a human → **Redirected** (not billed).
- If the shopper doesn’t return → finalizes as **Assisted** (billed).

### **🕐 Why the 12-hour grace period?**

It ensures shoppers have enough time to return if they still need help — so you’re never billed for an unresolved conversation.  If no further assistance is requested within that window, it counts towards assists. These apply only once at conversation level.

### **📊 How you track Assists**

In your **Inbox**, every conversation is tagged:

- **Ongoing** → Shopper still active in the session. Sessions are automatically marked as **Closed **with 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Closed** → Ended, waiting for 12-hour window before marking it **Assisted **or**Redirected** 
- **Assisted** → Resolved by Asa (billed)
- **Redirected** → Handed off to a human (not billed)

You can review every finalized Assist in your dashboard for full transparency.

### **📈 How Assists affect your plan**

Your plan includes a set number of Assists per month.

- **Assisted conversations** → Count toward your plan
- **Redirected or non-commercial chats** → Do not count
