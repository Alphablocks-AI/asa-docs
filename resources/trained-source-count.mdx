Both free and paid Asa plans limit the number of knowledge sources Asa can access as a knowledge base for responding accurately to storefront visitors and customers.

**<u>Files & Links:</u>** Each file and URL is treated as a single knowledge source.

**<u>Integrations:</u>**

- **Shopify:** Each product, article, page, or policy counts as one knowledge source. Metafields and reviews are included with products, not counted separately.
- **Notion:** Each page counts as a separate knowledge source.
- **JudgeMe Product Reviews:** Linked to Shopify products, these are not counted separately and are included with the associated product.
- **Yotpo product Reviews:** Linked to Shopify products, these are not counted separately and are included with the associated product.
- **Google Drive:** Each doc/file counts as a separate knowledge source.
