# **Best Practices**

[Asa AI Agent](https://asa.alphablocks.ai/) can consume all the support content you added via our [dashboard](https://tryasa.com/) to immediately offer your customers accurate and trustworthy answers. Here’s how you ensure your content is optimized for AI support, both around creating new support content, and optimizing existing content.

- **Identify Trends:** Analyze recent customer interactions—via Asa or other channels—to spot recurring topics and create targeted content.
- **Leverage Recurring Macros:** Instead of repeatedly handling common issues, compile detailed responses into internal docs or blog posts. Training Asa with this content helps automate responses, freeing your team for higher-priority tasks.
- **Prioritize Quality Over Quantity:** More content isn’t always better. Focus on clear, concise, and relevant information to maximize Asa’s effectiveness in automating frontline support.
- **Utilize the Content Gaps Feature:** This tool identifies missing information critical to addressing recurring customer queries, helping you refine your content.
- **Remove Outdated Content:** Delete irrelevant trained sources to ensure customers receive only accurate, up-to-date answers.
- **Avoid Data Duplication & Conflicts:** Ensure consistency in Asa’s training data, as conflicting information may lead to incorrect responses.
- **Leverage Integrations over document uploads:** Use our Shopify and CMS integrations to automatically update Asa with product changes via webhook, keeping information current without manual effort.

Our team is continuously enhancing your dashboard with unified intelligence features. These will analyze past and present conversations, detect recurring themes, and suggest or even generate content for quick approval—allowing Asa to evolve into a smarter, more autonomous system.
