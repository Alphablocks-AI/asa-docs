Assuming you’ve already added content and customized Asa to match your brand - you’re ready to test and deploy it on your storefront.

# **Playground**

Use the **Playground** (top right) to try out your assistant before going live. It’s your space to preview responses, fine-tune behavior, and make sure everything feels right before real shoppers interact with it.

# **Deploy**

The **Deploy** section is where you configure and deploy your assistant - the final step before going live. Everything you need to deploy Asa on your storefront smoothly is outlined below, from code snippets to instructions.
