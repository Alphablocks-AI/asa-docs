# Conversations

The **Conversations** section provides a detailed overview of every interaction between your customers and the AI Assistant.

Use it to monitor all conversations, identify where Asa needed help, and continuously refine your assistant’s responses, tone, and accuracy.

### View: All Conversations

All conversations are shown by default — giving you a complete view of every user interaction in one place.

### Filters

You can narrow down results using the filters at the top of the page:

- **Date Range:** View conversations that occurred between specific start and end dates.
- **Status Type:** Filter by conversation outcome.
  - **Assisted:** Asa successfully answered the user’s query — these count toward your Assist total.
  - **Redirected:** Asa couldn’t help, so the conversation was handed off to your support team — these do not count toward Assists.
- **Topics:** Quickly filter by conversation tags (e.g., _Products_, _Orders_, _Shipping_). This helps you focus on specific subjects or areas of concern.
- **Clear:** Remove all filters and reset the view to show all conversations again.

### Conversations Panel (Left)

This panel lists all recorded interactions with key details for each conversation:

- **Status Tag:** Displays whether the conversation was _Assisted_ or _Redirected_.
- **Topic:** Auto-tagged based on what the conversation was about — useful for identifying common patterns or recurring themes.
- **Last Message Time:** Shows when the most recent message was sent in that conversation.
- **Duration:** Displays how long the conversation lasted from start to finish.
- **Copy ID:** Click this button to copy the conversation ID — share it with our support team if you need help or want to raise a ticket for that specific conversation.

### Messages Panel (Right)

When you click on a conversation, the detailed message history appears on the right side:

- **User Message:** The message sent by the customer — displayed on the right side of the chat.
- **Asa Response:** The assistant’s reply — displayed on the left. This may include text, images, or interactive UI elements.
- **System Message:** Indicates user actions during the conversation (e.g., _clicked Learn More_, _viewed product page_, etc.). These are logged interactions, not replies.
- **Response Confidence Tags:** Show how confident Asa was in its response based on the information available.
- **Sources:** The content Asa used to generate its response — pulled directly from your uploaded materials.

> **Note:** If you need assistance with any conversation, simply **click “Copy ID”** next to it and share that ID with our team to raise a support request.
