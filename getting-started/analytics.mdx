# Analytics

The **Analytics** section helps you track, analyze, and optimize your AI assistant’s performance.\
Use it to monitor engagement, understand user behavior, and identify opportunities to improve efficiency and customer experience.

### Time Filter

Use the **Days filter** (e.g., _7 days_, _30 days_, _90 days_) to view analytics for a specific period.\
This lets you compare performance trends over time and make data-driven improvements.

### Key Metrics

Each analytics card gives you a quick snapshot of your assistant’s activity and impact during the selected time frame:

- **Total Conversations:** The total number of user-initiated interactions with your assistant. Each time a user starts a new chat, it counts as one conversation.
- **Total Users:** The total number of unique users who interacted with your assistant - a measure of reach and adoption.
- **Total AI Messages:** The total number of messages sent by your AI assistant during conversations - showing engagement and response volume.
- **Product Views:** The number of times users clicked to view a product page from within a conversation - an indicator of user interest and browsing intent.
- **Add to Cart:** The total number of times users clicked _Add to Cart_ directly from Asa’s responses - a sign of strong purchase intent driven by the assistant.

### Performance Funnel

The **Performance Funnel** visualizes how user interactions progress through different stages - helping you assess assistant effectiveness and user satisfaction.

It shows comparison for the following metrics:

- **All Conversations:** Total user-initiated conversations.
- **Assisted by Asa:** Conversations successfully handled by the assistant.
- **Low-Intent:** Basic or casual conversations (e.g., greetings like “Hi” or “Hello”).
- **Redirected to Team:** Conversations that were handed off to your human support team.
- **Positive CX Ratings:** Conversations where users gave a positive experience rating - indicating satisfaction and resolved queries.
- **Negative CX Ratings:** Conversations with a negative rating - showing dissatisfaction or unresolved issues - can be redirected ones.
- **Neutral CX Ratings:** Conversations with no rating provided by the user.

### How to Use

- Monitor total engagement and conversion activity over your chosen time frame.
- Use the funnel to pinpoint where user interactions drop off or escalate to support.
- Track satisfaction trends through CX ratings and identify areas where Asa can improve.

> **Note:** Regularly reviewing these metrics helps you understand how well Asa assists users, where handovers happen most, and how effectively the assistant contributes to user satisfaction and conversions.
