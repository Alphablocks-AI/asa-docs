# **Add Content**

The **“Add Content”** section allows you to connect Asa to apps, upload files, links, or use pre-structured templates for efficient training and retrieval using our advanced _Learning Engine_. Here’s how you can enrich your agent with company knowledge, product catalog, and policies to ensure grounded responses for your users.

## **Connect with Apps**

Connect third-party apps (such as CMS, file storage, reviews, etc.) to enable seamless data import and sync. Choose the integration from the list and follow the connection steps provided for each in their respective guides

## **Upload Files**

****_Supported Formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV._****

- Just drag and drop your files into the upload area — or click **Choose File** to select one or more from your device.
- Once you’ve made your selection, click **Add**. You’ll have the option to tag the content — totally optional, but recommended. Tags help us understand what you’re uploading, so our Learning Engine can organize it better. That means faster, more accurate answers when your users need them.

## **Import from Links**

_Bring in content by adding public URLs from help centers, blogs, or other web pages._

- Paste your website or blog URLs into the **Enter a URL** field. Make sure they’re in the correct format — like [_https://example.com_](https://example.com)_._
- Use the **Include linked pages** button to pick additional URLs found within the parent page — and add their content too.
- Click **Add**. Our Learning Engine will pull in the content, process it, and organize everything for quick, accurate results.

# **Manage Content**

The **Manage Content** section lets you view and organize the content your agent has been trained on. Check training status, see last updated dates, review details, and remove anything that’s no longer needed — keeping your knowledge base clean and efficient.

- **Source**: Includes file names, URLs, source names from apps, and templates. Clicking a source name will either open it in a new tab or download the file — depending on the type.
- **Tags**: Tags are added manually by you or automatically by our Learning Engine — helping highlight which category of content has been trained with the associated source. Hover over **\+X more** to preview all tags for that content source.
- **Type**: This simply shows the type of upload or import — for record-keeping purposes.
- **Status**: Shows the current status of the content — _Trained_, _Processing_, or _Failed_. If it gets stuck or fails (rare, but possible), delete the resource and upload it again. Refresh the page to see the latest status updates.
- **Last Updated**: Last Date and time (in your local timezone) when the content source was updated
- **Actions**: Click the **•••** (more options) icon to take action. To see exactly what Asa learned, click **View Content** — it shows the extracted content, word for word. If the content looks outdated or incorrect, just click **Delete** to remove it.
