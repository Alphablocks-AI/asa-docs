Follow these steps to connect Asa to your [Judge.Me](http://judge.me/) account using their official API. This allows Asa to read your product reviews and support features like curated, dynamic pros and cons — giving users honest feedback based on real reviews.

### **Step 1: Open Judge.Me in Shopify**

- In your Shopify dashboard, go to **Settings \> Apps and Sales Channels**.
- Under **Installed Apps**, find **Judge.Me Reviews**.
- Click it, then select **Open App** in the top-right corner.

### **Step 2: Get Your API Token and Subdomain**

- In the **Judge.Me** sidebar, go to **General Settings** \> **Integrations** tab.
- Click **View API Token** in the top-right corner.
- Copy the following values:
  - **Private API Token**
  - **Shopify Subdomain** — this is the part before `.myshopify.com`

Example URL to help you locate your subdomain: `https://admin.shopify.com/store/[your-shopify-subdomain]/apps/judgeme/shop/general_settings/integrations`

### **Notes**

- Be sure to double-check your **Shopify subdomain** — it should exactly match the one used in your Shopify URL.
- The **API token** provides secure, limited access to review data only — safe to use with Asa.
