Follow these steps to connect Asa to your Google Drive using Google’s secure OAuth process. This integration enables your Asa AI assistant to access and learn from the documents you store in your Drive.

### Step 1: Connect Your Google Drive Account

- In your Asa dashboard, go to **Add Content**, open the **Apps** tab, and find the **Google Drive** card.
- Click **Connect** - this will open the Google OAuth sign-in window.

If you’re not logged into Google, sign in with your Google account credentials. Once the connection is authorized, the **Google Picker** window will automatically open.

> **Note:** Connecting your Drive doesn’t automatically train Asa on your documents. You’ll choose which files to train in Step 2.

### Step 2: Choose Files and Train

- In the Google Picker, select the files or folders you want Asa to learn from.
- Click **Upload & Train** - the process usually takes 1–2 minutes depending on the file size and number of documents.

To confirm training was successful, go to **Manage Content \> Integrations**. You’ll see your selected Google Drive files listed along with their training status.

### Notes

- Click the <Icon icon="list-ul" /> icon next to **Connected** under Google Drive to add more files or retrain updated ones.
- If you’re using a shared or business Google Workspace account, ensure you have permission to connect third-party integrations.
- After updating a file in Google Drive, retrain it using the **( )** icon to keep Asa up to date.
