Follow these steps to connect Asa to your Shopify account using a **custom app with Admin API access**. This setup lets Asa learn from your product listings, metafields, blogs, pages, and store policies.

### **Step 1: Create a Custom App in Shopify**

- In your Shopify dashboard, go to **Settings** \> **Apps and Sales Channels** \> **Develop Apps** \> **Build apps in Dev Dashboard**.
- Click **Create App** from the top right.

_If you can’t access the _**_Dev Dashboard_**_ section, you may not have the required setup/permissions. Check _[_<u>Shopify’s guide</u>_](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types/custom-apps)_ or contact your store admin. If you’re still having trouble, feel free to reach out to us at _[**_<u>help@alphablocks.ai</u>_**](mailto:help@alphablocks.ai)**_._**

### **Step 2: Name Your App**

- Name your app **"Asa Custom App"**
- Click **Create**

### **Step 3: Add Admin API Access Scopes**
Under the section **Access** \> **Scopes** copy-paste the following scopes:

```markdown Access Scopes
  read_analytics,read_app_proxy,write_app_proxy,read_customer_events,read_custom_pixels,write_custom_pixels,
  read_customers,read_price_rules,read_discounts,read_discounts_allocator_functions,read_draft_orders,read_files,
  read_fulfillment_constraint_rules,read_fulfillments,read_inventory,read_legal_policies,read_locales,
  read_locations,read_markets,read_metaobject_definitions,read_metaobjects,read_online_store_navigation,
  read_online_store_pages,read_order_edits,read_orders,read_pixels,write_pixels,read_product_feeds,
  read_product_listings,read_products,read_publications,read_reports,read_script_tags,write_script_tags,read_content,
  read_translations
```
- Click **Release**

### **Step 3: Navigate to Settings Tab**

- Go to the **Settings** tab
- Under Credentials, make note of **Client ID** and **Secret**. You'll need these in Asa Dashboard.


### **Step 4: Connect Shopify in Asa**

- In your **Asa dashboard**, go to **Add Content**, open the **Integrations** tab, and click **Connect** under **Shopify**.
- You’ll be asked to enter the following details:

  - **Admin API Access Client ID**:
  - Paste the lient ID you noted from previous step.
  - **Admin API Access Secret**:
  - Paste the Secret you noted from previous step.
  - **Storefront Public URL**:
  - This is your live store URL — for example:

    `https://example.com` or `https://acme.com`.

  - **Shopify Subdomain**:
  - In Shopify, go to **Settings \> Domains** and find the domain that ends in `.myshopify.com`.

    If your admin URL is:

    `https://admin.shopify.com/store/acme/settings/domains`

    Then your subdomain is: `acme`.

_Make sure all fields are filled in accurately before clicking _**_Connect_**_ to complete the setup._


### **Step 5: Select Content and Train**

- After connecting, a dialog will open to select products, blogs, pages, or policies
- If it doesn’t appear, click the **<Icon icon="list-ul" />** icon next to **Connected** under Shopify
- Choose the content you want Asa to learn from and click **Add Content**

Training usually takes a couple of minutes.

To verify everything is working, go to **Manage Content** \> **Integrations** and check the training status of the selected items.

### **Notes**

- Use the <Icon icon="list-ul" /> icon next to Shopify to add more content or retrain updated items anytime
- You must have the right permissions to create custom apps in Shopify
- For secure setup, only the scopes you selected are accessed by Asa — nothing more
