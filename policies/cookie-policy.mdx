This Cookie Policy explains how Alphablocks Tech Pvt. Ltd. (collectively "Alphablocks", "we", "us", and "our"), our service providers, and advertising partners automatically collect information through [<u>ww.alphablocks.com</u>](http://ww.alphablocks.com) and our other websites (the “Sites”), and in connection with services and our marketing activities.

## **Cookies and similar technologies we use**

- **Cookies** are text files that websites store on a visitor’s device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of tracking user activity and patterns, helping the visitor navigate between pages efficiently, remembering preferences, improving the visitor’s browsing experience, and enabling functionality, analytics, and targeted advertising. Cookies used on our Sites include cookies that we serve as well as cookies served by third parties that we work with to enable the services they provide, such as analytics services that track traffic and usage. You can learn more about cookies and how to control them at [<u>www.allaboutcookies.org</u>](http://www.allaboutcookies.org).
- **Web beacons, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs**, are typically used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked, typically to compile statistics about usage of websites and the success of marketing campaigns.
- **Browser web storage** (including HTML5), also known as locally stored objects, functions like cookies but enables the storage of a larger amount of data.
- **Session replay**. We use third party software code to record users’ interactions with the Sites in a manner that allows us to watch and analyze visual reconstructions of those user sessions. The replays include users’ clicks, mobile app touches, mouse movements, scrolls, and keystrokes/key touches during those sessions. These replays help us diagnose usability problems and identify areas for improvement. One of the providers of this technology is Posthog, which you can learn about here: [<u>https://posthog.com/session-replay</u>](https://posthog.com/session-replay)
- **Chatbot features.** The Sites provides users with chatbots that users can use to get information and support. We and the third parties that support these features monitor and record the information you submit to the chat to enable the chat and for the other purposes described in our Privacy Policy. When you use these features, you are not communicating with a human.
