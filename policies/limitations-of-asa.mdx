**Effective day 1 January 2025**

We built Asa to help you shop with confidence by answering questions about our products, policies, and store. But since Asa is powered by AI, there are a few important things to know:

### **✅ What Asa Can Do**

- Answer questions about our catalog, reviews, and store policies.
- Suggest products, bundles, or alternatives based on your needs.
- Share information drawn directly from our site and uploaded content.
- Connect you with brand team if your question needs a human touch.

### **⚠️ What Asa Can’t Do**

- **Guarantee 100% accuracy** — Asa relies on the latest synced data, and mistakes are possible.
- **Replace expert advice** — Asa is not a doctor, pharmacist, lawyer, or financial advisor. For health, safety, or legal questions, please consult a professional.
- **Reflect instant changes** — Prices, promotions, or stock updates may take time to sync.
- **Handle emergencies** — Asa isn’t designed for urgent or critical situations.

### **🔒 Privacy & Safety**

- Conversations with Asa are kept secure and follow our store’s privacy policy.
- Personal or sensitive information should not be shared with Asa - except for order tracking - but should be limited to only required.

### **🧑 Human Support**

If Asa can’t answer your question or you’d prefer to speak with a real person, you can always reach to storefront support directly.
