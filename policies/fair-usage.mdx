This Fair Usage Policy (“FUP”) is incorporated into, and forms part of, the Alphablocks’ Terms of Service. This FUP applies to all Customers, Permitted Users and People who use the Services.

## **General**

To keep the Services running safely and smoothly, you agree not to and not to permit or encourage anyone else to:

 1. use the Services for any illegal or prohibited purpose or in violation of any applicable laws (including without limitation data protection, privacy, artificial intelligence (AI) and export control laws) in connection with using the Services;
 2. probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network used with the Services;
 3. tamper with, reverse engineer or hack the Services, circumvent any security or authentication measures of the Services or attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services (or any portion thereof) or related systems, networks or data (including through spoofing or social engineering);
 4. modify or disable the Services or use the Services in any manner that interferes with or disrupts the integrity or performance of the Services or related systems, network or data;
 5. access or search the Services by any means other than our publicly supported interfaces;
 6. copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, or disclose any part of the Services in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”;
 7. access or use the Services in order to monitor its availability, performance, or functionality for competitive purposes;
 8. overwhelm or attempt to overwhelm our infrastructure by imposing an unreasonably large load on the Services that consume extraordinary resources, such as by: (i) using “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers” or other automated systems to send more request messages to our servers than a human could reasonably send in the same period of time using a normal browser; or (ii) going far beyond the use parameters for any given Service as described in its corresponding documentation;
 9. use the Services to generate or send unsolicited communications, advertising, phishing or spam, or otherwise cause Alphablocks to become impaired in its ability to send communications on its own or on its customers’ behalf (e.g., by causing Alphablocks to become registered on any Email DNS blocked list or otherwise be denied services by any other third party communications service provider);
10. misrepresent yourself or disguise the origin of any data, content or other information you submit (including by “spoofing”, “phishing”, manipulating headers or other identifiers, impersonating anyone else, or falsely implying any sponsorship or association with Alphablocks or any third party) or access the Services via another user’s account without their permission;
11. Submit (or post, upload, display, share, instruct to be used or otherwise provide) data, content, fonts or other information, that (i) you don’t have the right to utilize (including confidential or personal information you are not authorized to disclose) or which otherwise infringes Alphablocks’ or a third party’s intellectual property or other rights; (ii) and/or is deceptive, manipulative, exploitative, fraudulent, bullying, threatening, misleading, illegal, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harmful to minors, pornographic, indecent, harassing, hateful, violent, encourages illegal or tortious conduct, is religiously, racially or ethnically offensive, or is otherwise inappropriate in Alphablocks’ discretion; (iii) contains viruses, malware, bots, worms, scripting exploits or other similar materials; or (iv) could otherwise cause damage to Alphablocks or any third party;
12. use meta tags or any other “hidden text” including Alphablocks’ trademarks; or
13. engage in any activity that may result in unlawful bias or discrimination of an individual or group of individuals.

You agree not to use and not to permit or encourage anyone else to use (including by means of prompting or generating any Output) any AI Products for the following purposes:

1. To make or directly facilitate automated decisions that will impact an individual's safety, rights, well-being, or which produces legal effects concerning an individual or similar significant effects concerning an individual;
2. To provide any financial, legal, medical or other professional advice or the practice of any occupation subject to licensing requirements under applicable laws;
3. In a manner that constitutes use as a medical device or medical device software;

6. Input image or text that potentially is classified harmful across several categories as per OpenAI’s content moderation policies.
7. Generating or promoting disinformation, misinformation, or other intentionally deceiving or misleading content.
8. Any use case which is deemed “high-risk” under applicable AI legislation, including but not limited to use of an AI Product for: biometric identification and classification; emotional recognition; the safety component of critical infrastructure; the safety component of a product; determining access to education and vocational training; recruitment, monitoring or terminating employment of individuals; making a creditworthiness assessment or establishing a credit score; risk assessing or pricing life and health insurance, evaluating eligibility for essential services.
